        <h2>Brant Point Light Station</h2>
        <p>
          Brant Point Light is a lighthouse located on Nantucket Island. The
          station was established in 1746, automated in 1965, and is still in
          operation. The current tower was added to the National Register of
          Historic Places on October 28, 1987; it has the distinction of being
          the tenth light on the point, in addition to several range lights.
          Four of the others burned or blew down, two were condemned, two were
          unsatisfactory, and the remaining one stands unused.
